# Common Angular Starter Kit

Common Angular Starter Kit including modern tools and workflow based on angular-cli, best practices from the community, a scalable base template and a good learning base.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.2.

### Benefits

- Quickstart a project in seconds and focus on features, not on frameworks or tools
- Industrial-grade tools, ready for usage in a continuous integration environment and DevOps
- Scalable architecture with base app template including example components, services and tests

# Getting started

1. Go to project folder and install dependencies:
 ```bash
npm install
 ```
 
2. Launch development server, and open `localhost:4200` in your browser:
```bash
npm start
```

# Main tasks

Task automation is based on [NPM scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).

Tasks                         | Description
------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
npm start                     | Run development server on `http://localhost:4200/`
npm build                     | Lint code and build app for production in `dist/` folder
npm lint                      | Lint code
npm run test                  | Run unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) in watch mode

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

# What's in the box

The app template is based on [HTML5](http://whatwg.org/html), [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org). The translation files use the common [JSON](http://www.json.org) format.

#### Tools

Development, build and quality processes are based on [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) and
